These are project files for Pneumonia Detection using kaggle dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data

Python Code Notebook - PneumoniaDetectionAndClassification_May17.ipynb

Four models were developed to predict bboxes for Pneumonia Detection, and each of the models' .yaml and weights.h5 files are placed in their respective folder. To use these for execution, the project_path in the notebook should be updated or these files should be placed in the project_path.

Classification Model's .yaml and weights.h5 files are placed in its respective folder

combined_regr_metrics.csv contains the model metrics info colated externally after running each model seperately

submission.csv is the output of bbox prediction on test data set using model3

PneumoniaClassPrediction.csv are is the output of prediction on test data set using the classification model.
